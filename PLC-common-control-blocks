PLC Control blocks and function blocks

Timer (TON): This function block is used to create a time delay in the program.
It is commonly used in applications where a delay is required before a specific action takes place.

Counter (CTU): This function block is used to count the number of times an input signal is detected.
It is commonly used in applications where a specific number of events need to occur before an action takes place.

Compare (CMP): This function block is used to compare two values and determine if they are equal, greater than, or less than each other.
It is commonly used in applications where certain conditions need to be met before an action takes place.

Set/Reset (SR): This function block is used to set or reset a specific output based on the state of one or more input signals.
It is commonly used in applications where a specific output needs to be turned on or off based on certain conditions.
