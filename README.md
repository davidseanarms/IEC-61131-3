# IEC-61131-3
IEC 61131 is a set of international standards for programmable logic controllers (PLCs). 

IEC 61131 is a set of international standards for programmable logic controllers (PLCs). It provides a common framework for programming, testing, and maintaining these devices, which are used in industrial automation and control systems.

The IEC 61131 standard defines five programming languages for PLCs: ladder diagram (LD), function block diagram (FBD), structured text (ST), instruction list (IL), and sequential function chart (SFC). These languages are used to write programs that control the behavior of the PLC.

The standard also defines a set of programming interfaces, or function blocks, that can be used to perform common control tasks, such as math operations, logic operations, and communication with other devices. These function blocks can be reused across different programs, which helps to simplify programming and reduce errors.

IEC 61131 also provides guidelines for testing and debugging PLC programs, as well as for documenting and maintaining them over time. This helps to ensure that PLCs operate reliably and efficiently, and that they can be easily modified or updated as needed.

Overall, IEC 61131 helps to standardize the programming and maintenance of PLCs, which can improve the safety, reliability, and performance of industrial control systems.
